      content="Los Angeles City Planning and Los
    Angeles Department of Transportation are working to update the City's
    Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program to meet transportation demand
    in a sustainable way. The proposed update would require certain new
    development projects to implement strategies such as supporting transit,
    telecommuting, walking, carshare, neighborhood shuttles, and other
    strategies that reduce vehicle trips. This site allows developers to determine
    compliance of their projects with the proposed ordinance."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
