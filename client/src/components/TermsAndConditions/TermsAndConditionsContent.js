        The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), in partnership
        with the Department of City Planning and Hack for LA (a project of Civic
        Tech Structure), has developed the City of Los Angeles Transportation
        Demand Management (TDM) Calculator (TDM Calculator) to provide the
        public with an understanding of the TDM Ordinance. Currently available
        for review: Council File 15-0719-S19 / the Los Angeles Department of
        City Planning website:

        . The TDM Ordinance proposes to revise regulations that require eligible
        land use development projects to adopt TDM strategies with the goal to
        reduce the reliance on drive-alone trips in the City of Los Angeles. The
        term “City” as used below shall refer to the City of Los Angeles. The
        terms “City” and “Hack for LA” as used below shall include their
        respective affiliates, sub-consultants, employees, volunteers, and
        representatives.

        This digital review tool, the TDM Calculator, has been provided to You,
        the User, as a public service to assess different scenarios that land
        use development would need to comply with if the City were to adopt the
        TDM Ordinance. LADOT is pleased to be able to provide this information
        to the public. LADOT believes that the public is most effectively served
        when they are provided access to the technical tools that inform the
        public policy-making process that governs private and public land-use
        investments. However, in using the TDM Calculator, You agree to be bound
        by this TDM Calculator User Agreement (this Agreement).{" "}

        non-exclusive license to use the TDM Calculator on a computer system
        owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by You in Your own facilities, as
        set out below and provided that You know and follow the terms of this
        Agreement. Your failure to follow the terms of this Agreement shall

        worked with the Department of City Planning and Hack for LA to develop
        the TDM Calculator’s parameters, including potential TDM strategies, and
        program point targets that could apply to land use development. However,
        since the TDM Ordinance is a draft regulation and not current law, it
        could further change, or be adopted in whole, or in part, denied, or
        abandoned, the information herein should not be interpreted to be
        binding on land use development regulation outcomes that inform
        investment decisions. Due to the dynamic nature of the information
        contained within the TDM Calculator and the reliance upon information
        from outside sources, the City does not guarantee the accuracy or
        reliability of the information transmitted from this web site. The TDM
