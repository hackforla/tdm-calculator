VALUES(
'What are the differences between the TDM Calculator and the VMT Calculator?',
'<div>The TDM program will apply to all projects that are above a threshold 
regardless if they need a discretionary action, while projects also need to evaluate 
VMT impacts if they require a discretionary action (also known as an entitlement) 
from the City. For projects that require CEQA analysis, some projects today 
need to reduce their VMT impact by applying TDM strategies as mitigation measures. 
For ease of use, once the TDM Ordinance update takes effect, applicants will 
want to complete the TDM Calculator first ensure compliance, and determine 
if any of the TDM strategies they selected will help to include as VMT 
mitigation measures in the VMT Calculator if they found any impacts during the 
CEQA process. When the TDM Ordinance update takes effect, developers may claim 
TDM strategies as regulatory compliance measures (RCMs) that are required to 
comply with the TDM Program, and thereby demonstrate a lower VMT when evaluating
their project&apos;s CEQA analysis. 
This will allow some projects to reduce VMT through the design and features 
of the project, creating opportunities for CEQA streamlining.
